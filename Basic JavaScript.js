/** Understand 'String' Immutability

 * In JavaScript, String values are **immutable**, which means that they cannot be altered once created.
 * 
 * For example, the following code will produce an error because the letter B in the string Bob cannot be changed to the letter J:
 * 
 * let myStr = "Bob";
 * myStr[0] = "J";
 * Note that this does not mean that myStr could not be re-assigned. The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new value, like this:
 * 
 * let myStr = "Bob";
 * myStr = "Job"; 
*/
